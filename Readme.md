[Tanstack-query](https://tanstack.com/query/docs) and
[Nuqs](https://github.com/47ng/nuqs) for being such a joy to work with.

### Inspiration 💐

> Our requirements are more modest but at the same time more responsible:
> buildings, furniture, drinking glasses may well be consumer items that
> we can destroy without regret after they have served for some short or
> long period, but while we use them we expect them to full fill their role and serve us perfectly, so perfectly that we can also derive aesthetic
> enjoyment from observing them in use.
