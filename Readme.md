## Thingies for Reactjs

My work involves complex UI in React, this is how I roll for now.
We have `Dumb`, `Smart-ish` and `Inspired`.

### Lore

Attempt 27392794472. Previous work, [Boost](https://github.com/polmoneys/boost), [Apoteosis](https://www.apotheosis.party/), [Hug component](https://github.com/polmoneys/Hug)...

### Inspired

`GridTemplateColumns` inspired by MUI.

```tsx
// works for gap & padding too

<GridTemplateColumns
    gridTemplateColumns={{
        xs: '1fr',
        md: '1fr 1fr',
        lg: '1fr 1fr 1fr',
        xl: '1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr',
    }}
>
    {/* children */}
</GridTemplateColumns>
```

**Work in progress**

### Inspiration 💐

> Our requirements are more modest but at the same time more responsible:
> buildings, furniture, drinking glasses may well be consumer items that
> we can destroy without regret after they have served for some short or
> long period, but while we use them we expect them to full fill their role and serve us perfectly, so perfectly that we can also derive aesthetic
> enjoyment from observing them in use.
