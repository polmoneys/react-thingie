## Thingies for Reactjs

My work involves complex UI in React, this is how I roll for now.
We have `Dumb`, `Smart-ish` and `Inspired` (favs) components

### Lore

It all started with **createThingie** that returns `<ContextProvider>` and `useSelection` hook. [Read More](/src/Thingie/Readme.md) about Thingie.

**Work in progress**

### Inspiration 💐

> Our requirements are more modest but at the same time more responsible:
> buildings, furniture, drinking glasses may well be consumer items that
> we can destroy without regret after they have served for some short or
> long period, but while we use them we expect them to full fill their role and serve us perfectly, so perfectly that we can also derive aesthetic
> enjoyment from observing them in use.
